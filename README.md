# Insyde.Io

This project implements an AI-based road network optimization model using the A Search Algorithm* to find the shortest path in a grid-based city map. The model simulates real-world road planning by avoiding obstacles and optimizing road connectivity.

#Features
 Generates a synthetic city map with roads and obstacles
 Implements A Search Algorithm* to find the shortest path
 Visualizes the optimized road network using OpenCV and Matplotlib
 Fully compatible with Google Colab (uses cv2_imshow)
